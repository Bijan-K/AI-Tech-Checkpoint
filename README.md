# AI Tech Checkpoint

As there are better and better models coming out everyday, I made this list to at least have a general grasp on the technology as a whole.

This is a concise mostly personal collection of some of the AI technologies & researches that I have came across. This list does not endorse anything or is competing with any other List. It simply wishes to be informative(and for myself mostly).
