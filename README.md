*this is still a draft and there is still a lot I have yet to add*

# Collection of AI Tech

As there are better and better models coming out everyday, I made this list to atleast have a general grasp on it. Also with the speed AI is progressing this list will always be outdated. :thumbsup:

This is a concise mostly personal collection of __the best__ AI technologies & researches that I have came accross.

This list does not endorse anything or is competing with any other List. It simply wishes to be informative(for myself mostly). Also a lot of the information gathered here was extracted from the Bycloud youtube channel(the G.O.A.T. on this topic). [Definitely check out his YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bycloudAI).
