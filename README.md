_this is still a draft and there is still a lot I have yet to add_

# Collection of AI Tech

As there are better and better models coming out everyday, I made this list to at least have a general grasp on a checkpoint of AI technology as a whole. Also with the speed AI is progressing this list will always be outdated... so, yeah :thumbsup:

This is a concise mostly personal collection of **the best** AI technologies & researches(I will probably add more papers later) that I have came across.

This list does not endorse anything or is competing with any other List. It simply wishes to be informative(for myself mostly). Also a lot of the information gathered here was extracted from the Bycloud youtube channel. [Definitely check out his YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bycloudAI). 

There is an [AI News team on buttondown](https://buttondown.email/ainews) who make daily posts that summarizes almost all that has happened on AI discords/Twitters/subreddits on that day. I recommend following them if you really want to keep up with what is going on.
